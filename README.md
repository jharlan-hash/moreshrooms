# moreshrooms

ideas for my Minecraft mod:
New Mushrooms:
- **Glowshroom**: Emits light when placed, can be used to craft glowing blocks. Naturally spawns in dark caves, and can
be eaten for a temporary night vision effect.
- **Yellow Oyster Mushroom**: A variant of the oyster mushroom that has a yellow cap. Can be used in cooking recipes or as a dye.
Grows on the sides of dead trees in warm biomes.
- **Blue Chanterelle**: A rare mushroom that can be found in cold biomes. It has a blue cap and can be used to brew a special potion that grants **SOMETHING**
- **Morel Mushroom**: A mushroom that can be found in forest biomes. It has a distinctive honeycomb appearance and can be used in cooking recipes or as a dye.
- **Red Puffball Mushroom**: A mushroom that can be found in plains biomes. It has a red cap and can be used to create a smoke bomb item that creates a cloud of red smoke when thrown.
- **White Puffball Mushroom**: A mushroom that can be found in snowy biomes. It has a white cap and can be used to create a smoke bomb item that creates a cloud of white smoke when thrown.
- **Shelf Fungus**: A mushroom that grows on the sides of trees. It can be harvested and used to create a special type of block that can be used for building or decoration.

Eventually, I would also like to update the mushroom biome.
